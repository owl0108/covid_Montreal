# Tableau_covid-Montreal

### There seems to be an issue with accessing the website from the Google server, so the current code may not work (2020/11/24)


This is part of my personal project visualizing the spread of covid-19 in the Island of Montreal.

The repository contains Google Apps Script codes for fetching and storing data from the public health authority.
(main.gs meant to be triggered daily for updates.)
